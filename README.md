# Game of Domination

# How to Play Domination
# Setup
Each player chooses which color they are going to play and takes the corresponding number of pieces. The number of pieces and colors that are used depends on the number of players:
Two Players: Green and Red Playing Pieces – 18 of each color
Three Players: Green, Red, and Blue Playing Pieces – 13 of each color
Four Players: Green, Red, Blue and Yellow Playing Pieces – 13 of each color
Take one playing piece of each color that is in the game. One player randomly selects one of the pieces to determine who will start the game.
Setup the gameboard as shown below based on the number of players.

# Playing the Game
On a player’s turn they will make one move. They can either make a single move, a multiple move, or a reserve move.
In a three player game on each player’s first turn they must play their one piece that was kept off the gameboard to an unoccupied space on the gameboard.
After a player has made their move play will pass to the next player clockwise.

# Single Move
In a single move the player moves one of their playing pieces which is on a space by itself. This piece can be moved one space vertically or horizontally. The piece may never be moved diagonally. The piece can either be moved to an empty space, or a space with one or more playing pieces on it. If a piece is moved to a space with a stack of pieces on it, the piece that was just moved is placed on the top of the stack. A player can move their playing piece onto a stack containing their own pieces, pieces of other players, or both.

# Multiple Move
The other move that a player can make is a multiple move. In a multiple move a player can move a whole stack of pawns. A player may only move a stack if their pawn is on top of the stack. When a player wants to move a stack they choose how much of the stack that they want to move. They can either move the entire stack or take some pieces off the top of the stack and leave some of the playing pieces behind.
The player will then be able to move the stack a number of spaces up to the height of the stack they are moving. They can move the stack vertically or horizontally but not diagonally. When moving a stack it will only impact the pieces on the space that that stack lands on and won’t impact the pieces on the spaces that the stack was moved through.

# Reserving and Capturing Pieces
After moving your playing piece/stack you need to check the height of the stack that you moved the piece(s) to. If the new stack ever contains more than five pieces some of the pieces will be removed from the stack. Starting with the playing piece on the bottom of the stack, you will remove pieces until the stack only has five pieces remaining.

The pieces that were removed from the board will either be captured or put into reserve. All pieces not belonging to the player who made the move are captured. These pieces are removed and won’t be used for the rest of the game. Pieces belonging to the player who made the move will be added to their reserve pile.

# Reserve Move
If a player has playing pieces in reserve they can make a reserve move instead of a single or multiple move. To make a reserve move take one of your playing pieces in reserve and place it on any space on the gameboard. The reserve piece can be placed on an empty space, on a space containing one piece, or a space containing multiple pieces. Placing the reserve piece counts as your turn as you don’t get to move the piece you just added to the gameboard.

# End of Game
The game ends when only one player can still move pieces. This means that one player has their colored pieces on top of all of the stacks and none of the other players still have reserve pieces. The last player who can make a move wins the game.
